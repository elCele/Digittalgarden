>[!quote] ### Plot
>Oliver Twist is a poor boy of unknown parents; he is brought up in a workhouse in an inhuman way. He is later sold to an undertaker as an apprentice, but the cruelty and the unhappiness he experiences with his new master cause him to run away to London. There he falls into the hands of a gang of pickpockets, leader by the Artful Dodger and trained by the older Fagin, who try to make a thief out of him. One day, Oliver is taken to witness a theft by the gang. Mr Brownlow, the victim, is stricken by Oliver's ragged appearance and after learning more about the boy, decides to take him into his home. Oliver is eventually kidnapped by the gang and forced to commit a burglary; during the job, he his shot and wounded. He is then adopted by Mr Brownlow and at last receives kindness and affection.
>Investigations are made about who Oliver really is and it is discovered that he has noble origins. In the end, the gang leaders and Oliver's half-brother, who paid the thieves in order to ruin Oliver and have their father's property all for himself, are arrested.
